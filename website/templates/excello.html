    <h1>Excello @ NIME 2020</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the NIME 2020 installation for Excello. The following page
      will outline a self-guided experience for understanding and using
      Excello. There are two videos; one outlining the motivation behind
      Excello, and a second demonstrating how to use it. Below these I will
      document how to run Excello yourself along with some examples. All code
      and examples can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/hmattinson/Excello">Github repo</a>. Please
      submit your own compositions, we'd love to see!
    </p>

    <p>The paper published in NIME 2020 can be found here:

    <h2>Running Excello</h2>
      To use Excello, the code must be running somewhere, and Excel must be given
      a manifest file that points to where this is running so it can provide it as
      an add-in. You can run Excello on your own computer, or use an online hosted
      version. The online version should be easier but runs a little slower.
    <h4>Using an externally hosted version</h4>
    This was written for using Excel online, steps may differ slightly for
    different version of Excel.
    <ul>
      <li>Download this <a href="https://github.com/hmattinson/Excello/blob/master/Excel%20Music/manifest.xml">manifest.xml file</a></li>
      <li>Open <a href="https://github.com/hmattinson/Excello/blob/master/Excel%20Music.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a> (in an Excel version that supports add-ins)</li>
      <li>Insert > Office Add-ins > Upload My Add-in</li>
      <li>Find and upload the manifest.xml file you downloaded</li>
      <li>Excello will now be available in your home tab in the ribbon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Running Locally</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clone the Github Repo</li>
      <li>Run with Node (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/tutorials/excel-tutorial?tutorial-step=1">helpful Microsoft tutorial</a>)</li>
      <li>Open Excel (a version that supports add-ins)</li>
      <li>Insert > Office Add-ins > Upload My Add-in</li>
      <li>Find and upload the local_manifest.xml file you downloaded</li>
      <li>Excello will now be available in your home tab in the ribbon</li>
    </ul>
